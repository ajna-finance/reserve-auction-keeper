# Ajna Reserve Auction Keeper

An open source bot that monitors and participates in [Ajna Protocol](https://www.ajna.finance/) reserve auctions across Ethereum Mainnet and Base.

Reserve auctions are the mechanism by which Ajna "buys back and burns" its native token using surplus quote tokens (interest) earned by pools. This bot automates participation in these Dutch auctions, executing trades when prices become favorable.

Current status: funded strategy supports live execution. Mainnet uses a single-tx Flashbots bundle path, Base uses private RPC submission, and flash-arb now has an executor-backed dry-run/live path when a deployed executor and per-chain routes are configured. The Solidity fork suite now also locks in the current mainnet flash-arb topology constraint: the pinned USDC reserve-auction path can be quoted live, but it still reuses the locked AJNA/WETH flash pool on Uniswap V3, so a successful mainnet V3-only flash-arb route still depends on future liquidity topology.

## Risk Disclaimer

This software interacts with live blockchain networks and can move real assets. Use it at your own risk. It is provided for informational and operational purposes only and is not financial, investment, legal, tax, or security advice.

Transactions are irreversible and may lose funds due to bugs, misconfiguration, smart contract vulnerabilities, oracle or pricing errors, RPC or relay failures, MEV, slippage, gas volatility, protocol changes, or operator error. Profit estimates are not guarantees.

Use a dedicated hot wallet with only funds you are willing to lose. Start in dry-run mode, independently review and test your configuration, and actively monitor live execution.

Repository placement under an Ajna-related GitHub organization does not mean that any foundation, protocol contributor, tokenholder, or repository maintainer operates your keeper, custodies your funds, provides investment advice, or guarantees any outcome. Unless a separate written agreement says otherwise, running this keeper is solely the operator's responsibility.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for audit status and security issue reporting.

## How It Works

1. **Discovers pools** by scanning the Ajna PoolFactory for all deployed pools whose quote token matches the configured whitelist (built-in defaults plus any per-chain overrides in `config.json`)
2. **Monitors auctions** by polling each pool's reserve state via multicall
3. **Kicks auctions** when reserves are available and the 120-hour cooldown has elapsed (checks for unsettled liquidations first)
4. **Evaluates profitability** by comparing the Dutch auction price against configured market-price feeds
5. **Executes trades** via `takeReserves()` when the price meets your configured target, with MEV protection

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Foundry + `svm install 0.8.27` if you want to run the Solidity executor tests
- An Ethereum wallet with AJNA (Mainnet) or bwAJNA (Base) tokens
- RPC endpoints for Mainnet and/or Base
- Price API credentials for your chosen provider:
  `COINGECKO_API_KEY` or `COINGECKO_API_KEY_FILE` for `pricing.provider = "coingecko"` or `"hybrid"`
  `COINGECKO_API_PLAN=demo|pro|auto` optionally pins the CoinGecko host/header, default `auto`
  `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` or `ALCHEMY_API_KEY_FILE` for `pricing.provider = "alchemy"` or `"hybrid"`
  `pricing.provider = "alchemy"` fails fast at startup if Alchemy cannot price that chain's AJNA token
  `RPC_PROVIDER=alchemy` + `RPC_API_KEY` or `RPC_API_KEY_FILE` can be reused for Alchemy pricing automatically

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/reserve-auction-keeper.git
cd reserve-auction-keeper
npm install
npm run build

# Copy and edit config files
cp .env.example .env
cp config.example.json config.json
```

### Configure

**`.env`** — secrets (never commit this file):
```
# Choose exactly one trading key source:
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=./secrets/trading.key
# or:
# KEYSTORE_PATH=./secrets/trading.keystore.json
# KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_FILE=./secrets/trading.keystore.password

COINGECKO_API_KEY_FILE=./secrets/coingecko.key
# Optional: auto-detect by default. Set demo for Demo keys to avoid a first-request fallback.
# COINGECKO_API_PLAN=auto
ALCHEMY_API_KEY_FILE=./secrets/alchemy.key
RPC_PROVIDER=alchemy
RPC_API_KEY_FILE=./secrets/rpc-provider.key

# Recommended for stable mainnet Flashbots relay identity:
FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY_FILE=./secrets/flashbots-auth.key
```

**`config.json`** — bot settings:
```json
{
  "chains": {
    "base": {
      "enabled": true,
      "rpcUrl": "https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your_key",
      "privateRpcUrl": "https://base-private-rpc.example",
      "privateRpcTrusted": false,
      "quoteTokens": {
        "ALT": {
          "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000010",
          "coingeckoId": "your-coingecko-token-id"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "pricing": {
    "provider": "coingecko"
  },
  "strategy": "funded",
  "funded": {
    "targetExitPriceUsd": 0.10,
    "autoApprove": false
  },
  "dryRun": true
}
```

The Quick Start shown above runs the **funded** strategy only. If you also want the flash-arb path, add a `flashArb` block with per-chain routes and executors — see the "Strategy: Flash-Arb" subsection below. If you leave `strategy: "funded"` globally and also configure `flashArb.routes.<chain>` for the same chain, the keeper logs a dead-config warning at startup so the stale block doesn't quietly mislead you.


`chains.<chain>.quoteTokens` is additive by default. It merges with the chain's built-in quote-token whitelist and can override an existing symbol by reusing the same key. If you point an existing symbol at a different token address in `coingecko` or `hybrid` mode, also provide a new `coingeckoId`.

### Run

```bash
# Dry run mode (default) — logs what it would do without executing
npm run dev

# Production
npm start

# Lint
npm run lint

# Analyze execution payouts from JSON logs
npm run analytics:executions -- ./keeper.log

# Solidity executor tests
npm run test:contracts

# Mainnet fork tests for canonical pool verification and live flash-arb topology regression
npm run test:contracts:fork:mainnet
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

This runs the keeper as a long-lived service with:

- `config.json` mounted read-only at `/app/config.json`
- selected runtime variables interpolated from your local `.env`
- only file-based API and wallet secret inputs forwarded into the container
- a named Docker volume mounted at `/app/.cache/pool-discovery` so pool auto-discovery stays warm across restarts
- the existing `/health` endpoint exposed on port `8080` by default, or on `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` when set in your local `.env`

Recommended Docker secret pattern:

1. Put secret files on the host, for example under `./secrets/`.
2. In `.env`, point the bot at the in-container file paths:
   ```dotenv
   HEALTH_CHECK_PORT=8080
   COINGECKO_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/coingecko.key
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/alchemy.key
   RPC_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/rpc-provider.key
   PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/trading.key
   FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/flashbots-auth.key
   # or:
   # KEYSTORE_PATH=/run/secrets/trading.keystore.json
   # KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/trading.keystore.password
   ```
   Compose intentionally does not pass inline API keys, `PRIVATE_KEY`,
   `FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY`, or `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` values through to the container.
3. Copy [`docker/docker-compose.secrets.example.yml`](docker/docker-compose.secrets.example.yml) to `docker/docker-compose.override.yml` and edit the host-side bind mount paths if needed.
4. Start Compose with the override:
   ```bash
   docker compose \
     -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
     -f docker/docker-compose.override.yml \
     up -d --build
   ```

`docker/docker-compose.override.yml` is ignored by git so each operator can keep machine-specific secret paths locally.

If you change `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`, Compose now publishes the same host/container port and the container healthcheck probes that port too.

### systemd

For a Linux box that should start the Dockerized keeper on boot, use the sample unit in [`deploy/systemd/reserve-auction-keeper-compose.service`](deploy/systemd/reserve-auction-keeper-compose.service).

Assuming the repo lives at `/opt/reserve-auction-keeper`:

```bash
sudo cp deploy/systemd/reserve-auction-keeper-compose.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now reserve-auction-keeper-compose.service
sudo systemctl status reserve-auction-keeper-compose.service
```

If your checkout path is not `/opt/reserve-auction-keeper`, edit the unit's `WorkingDirectory` first.

Useful commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart reserve-auction-keeper-compose.service
sudo journalctl -u reserve-auction-keeper-compose.service -f
docker compose -f /opt/reserve-auction-keeper/docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f keeper
```

## Configuration

### Strategy: Funded (Passive Accumulator)

For AJNA holders who want to exit their position into quote tokens at a specific price.

- Set `targetExitPriceUsd` to your minimum acceptable value per AJNA spent (in USD worth of quote tokens)
- The bot will call `takeReserves()` when the auction price decays enough that each AJNA spent buys at least your target amount of quote tokens
- Pre-approve your AJNA tokens for each pool, or set `autoApprove: true`
- In live mode, `autoApprove` uses the same MEV/private submission path as the trade instead of a public approval transaction
- In `dryRun`, missing allowance is surfaced as a warning/error; the bot will not mutate state to auto-approve

### Strategy: Flash-Arb

Flash-arb now supports multiple execution families and chooses the best executable candidate offchain before submitting onchain:

- `v3v3`: Uniswap V3 flash source -> Ajna `takeReserves()` -> Uniswap V3 swap
- `v2v3`: Uniswap V2 flash source -> Ajna `takeReserves()` -> Uniswap V3 swap
- `v3v2`: Uniswap V3 flash source -> Ajna `takeReserves()` -> Uniswap V2 swap

- `strategy: "flash-arb"` uses the matching on-chain executor contract for the selected family
- `flashArb.onChainSlippageFloorPercent` sets the haircut applied to quoted AJNA output to derive `minAjnaOut` for the executor (protects against quote-vs-execution drift and sandwich extraction); `flashArb.minLiquidityUsd` and `flashArb.minProfitUsd` gate candidate selection before execution
- reserve-auction kicks now use a conservative pre-kick EV estimate; for flash-arb, set `flashArb.minProfitUsd > 0` if you want the keeper to pay gas to start auctions
- `flashArb.routes.<chain>.sources.<symbol>[]` declares AJNA-containing flash sources, each tagged as `uniswap-v2` or `uniswap-v3`
- `flashArb.routes.<chain>.swapRoutes.<symbol>[]` declares quote-token -> AJNA swap routes, each tagged as `uniswap-v2` or `uniswap-v3`
- `flashArb.routes.<chain>.executors` maps executor family -> deployed executor address
- `flashArb.routes.<chain>.quoterAddress` is required for any `uniswap-v3` swap route
- `flashArb.routes.<chain>.uniswapV2FactoryAddress` is required for any `uniswap-v2` swap route
- `uniswap-v3` swap routes must start with the quote token, end with AJNA/bwAJNA, and avoid reusing a `uniswap-v3` flash source in the same candidate
- legacy `flashLoanPools`, `quoteToAjnaPaths`, and top-level/default `executorAddress` still normalize into the `v3v3` family so existing configs keep working
- The runtime path is live, but you should still treat it as advanced/operator-only until fork tests exist for your target chains

### Mixed mode: different strategies per chain

A single keeper process can run different strategies on different chains. Set a per-chain `strategy` override and, if the chain has different economics (gas costs, liquidity), override the strategy-specific fields too:

```json
{
  "strategy": "funded",
  "funded": { "targetExitPriceUsd": 0.10 },
  "flashArb": { "minProfitUsd": 5, "minLiquidityUsd": 100, "routes": { "mainnet": {...} } },
  "chains": {
    "base": { "enabled": true, "rpcUrl": "...", "strategy": "funded" },
    "mainnet": {
      "enabled": true,
      "rpcUrl": "...",
      "strategy": "flash-arb",
      "flashArb": { "minProfitUsd": 50 }
    }
  }
}
```

- Per-chain `strategy` wins over the top-level default. Chains that omit it inherit the global value.
- Per-chain `flashArb.*` and `funded.*` blocks merge onto the top-level block field by field. Unset fields inherit the global value. Typo'd keys (e.g., the renamed `maxSlippagePercent`) are rejected at config load time.
- A chain that declares `strategy: "flash-arb"` still sources its route/executor config from the top-level `flashArb.routes.<chain>` block. The per-chain override is for profit/liquidity/slippage thresholds only.
- If a chain has a `flashArb` override but resolves to `strategy: "funded"` (or vice versa), the keeper logs a warning once at load time and ignores the unused block, so stale config doesn't silently mislead you.

Deploy the executor with:

```bash
DEPLOY_CHAIN=base npm run deploy:flash-arb-executor
cast wallet import deployer --interactive
DEPLOY_CHAIN=base npm run deploy:flash-arb-executor -- --broadcast --account deployer
```

Set `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_KIND` to choose the family:

- `v3v3` (default)
- `v2v3`
- `v3v2`

The wrapper fills `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_AJNA_TOKEN` plus the family-specific Uniswap router/factory defaults from the built-in chain preset for `mainnet`, `base`, `arbitrum`, `optimism`, or `polygon`, resolves the RPC URL from `DEPLOY_RPC_URL` or `RPC_PROVIDER` + `RPC_API_KEY` / `RPC_API_KEY_FILE`, and applies the family-specific constructor inputs. Override any constructor input with:

- `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_KIND`
- `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_AJNA_TOKEN`
- `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_SWAP_ROUTER`
- `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_UNISWAP_V2_FACTORY`
- `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_UNISWAP_V3_FACTORY`
- `FLASH_ARB_EXECUTOR_UNISWAP_V3_POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH`

The wrapper injects the resolved RPC URL through a Foundry RPC alias, refuses raw
secret-bearing flags like `--private-key`, `--mnemonic`, and verifier API-key flags,
and redacts any remaining key/secret/url-style forwarded args from its own logs. Use
`--account`, `--keystore`, `--password-file`, and environment-based verifier API keys
for live broadcasts instead.

If you already have a custom RPC URL for the target network, set `DEPLOY_RPC_URL` directly instead of relying on provider-based auto-construction.

### Key Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `dryRun` | `true` | Log opportunities without executing. **Start here.** |
| `pricing.provider` | `coingecko` | Price source: `coingecko`, `alchemy`, or asymmetric `hybrid` cross-check mode. `alchemy` fails fast on chains where Alchemy cannot price AJNA |
| `COINGECKO_API_PLAN` | `auto` | CoinGecko auth mode: `demo`, `pro`, or `auto` host detection |
| `chains.<chain>.quoteTokens.<symbol>.address` | unset | Adds or overrides a quote token whitelist entry for auto-discovery on that chain |
| `chains.<chain>.quoteTokens.<symbol>.coingeckoId` | unset | Required for new tokens when `pricing.provider` is `coingecko` or `hybrid`; optional in `alchemy` mode |
| `chains.<chain>.strategy` | unset | Per-chain override for `strategy`. Lets you run, e.g., `funded` on Base and `flash-arb` on Mainnet from the same keeper |
| `chains.<chain>.flashArb.*` | unset | Per-chain override of any `flashArb.*` field (`onChainSlippageFloorPercent`, `minLiquidityUsd`, `minProfitUsd`). Merges onto the top-level block |
| `chains.<chain>.funded.*` | unset | Per-chain override of any `funded.*` field. Merges onto the top-level block |
| `funded.targetExitPriceUsd` | `0.10` | Minimum USD value of quote tokens received per AJNA spent |
| `funded.autoApprove` | `false` | Auto-approve AJNA spending for pools |
| `flashArb.onChainSlippageFloorPercent` | `1` | Haircut % applied to DEX-quoted AJNA output to derive `minAjnaOut` enforced on-chain. Protects against quote-vs-execution drift and sandwich extraction within this window. Not a candidate-rejection gate. |
| `flashArb.minLiquidityUsd` | `100` | Minimum quote-token liquidity required before evaluating a flash-arb |
| `flashArb.minProfitUsd` | `0` | Minimum conservative USD profit after flash fee + slippage floor. Set above `0` to allow flash-arb reserve-auction kicks under the conservative pre-kick EV gate |
| `flashArb.executorAddress` | unset | Optional legacy/default `v3v3` executor address used when a chain route does not override it |
| `flashArb.routes.<chain>.quoterAddress` | unset | Uniswap V3 quoter used for executable `uniswap-v3` swap routes |
| `flashArb.routes.<chain>.uniswapV2FactoryAddress` | unset | Uniswap V2 factory used for executable `uniswap-v2` swap routes |
| `flashArb.routes.<chain>.executors.v3v3` | unset | Deployed executor for `v3v3` routes |
| `flashArb.routes.<chain>.executors.v2v3` | unset | Deployed executor for `v2v3` routes |
| `flashArb.routes.<chain>.executors.v3v2` | unset | Deployed executor for `v3v2` routes |
| `flashArb.routes.<chain>.sources.<symbol>[]` | unset | Flash sources for that quote token, each with `{ protocol, address }` |
| `flashArb.routes.<chain>.swapRoutes.<symbol>[]` | unset | Swap routes for that quote token, each with either `{ protocol: "uniswap-v3", path: "0x..." }` or `{ protocol: "uniswap-v2", path: ["tokenIn", "...", "ajna"] }` |
| `profitMarginPercent` | `5` | Required profit margin above gas costs |
| `gasPriceCeilingGwei` | `100` | Skip execution if gas exceeds this |
| `polling.idleIntervalMs` | `60000` | Poll interval when no auction is near profitability |
| `polling.activeIntervalMs` | `10000` | Poll interval when an auction is approaching target |
| `polling.profitabilityThreshold` | `0.2` | Switch to active polling when projected profit is within 20% of the gas-adjusted target |
| `alertWebhookUrl` | unset | Optional webhook for `alert` and `fatal` events |

## Safety

- **Dry run by default.** The bot will not execute any transactions until you set `dryRun: false`.
- **Use a dedicated hot wallet.** Never use your main wallet. Fund it with only the AJNA you're willing to trade.
- **`hybrid` pricing is asymmetric by design.** CoinGecko is the primary AJNA feed, while the quote-token leg is cross-checked against Alchemy when both are available. The keeper pauses if CoinGecko AJNA is unavailable, if both quote feeds are unavailable, or if the quote feeds diverge beyond the configured threshold.
- **CoinGecko Demo and Pro keys are both supported.** `COINGECKO_API_PLAN=auto` will switch hosts if CoinGecko returns an auth host mismatch, and `demo`/`pro` lets you pin it up front.
- **Custom quote tokens are config-driven and additive.** Add them under `chains.<chain>.quoteTokens` without changing source code. They merge with the built-in per-chain whitelist unless you explicitly override an existing symbol. In `coingecko` or `hybrid` mode, each new symbol also needs a `coingeckoId`.
- **Prefer file or keystore secret inputs.** `PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` or `KEYSTORE_PATH` + `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_FILE` keeps raw trading keys out of your shell environment.
- **Prefer file-based API key inputs in Docker.** `COINGECKO_API_KEY_FILE`, `ALCHEMY_API_KEY_FILE`, and `RPC_API_KEY_FILE` keep third-party credentials out of `docker inspect`.
- **Mainnet live mode uses single-tx Flashbots bundles.** The keeper prepares, signs, simulates, and submits a raw bundle, then retries across up to 3 target blocks.
- **Persist the Flashbots auth key.** `FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY_FILE` keeps a stable relay identity across restarts instead of generating a fresh one every boot.
- **Base and other `private-rpc` chains fail closed without an explicitly trusted private RPC.** Set both `privateRpcUrl` and `privateRpcTrusted: true` before live mode; a URL alone is not treated as MEV-safe.
- **Flash-arb requires at least one deployed family executor.** The keeper will refuse live flash-arb mode if a chain route is missing executable family mappings.
- **Flash-arb route topology is validated before execution.** The keeper rejects paths that do not decode to quote-token -> AJNA, mixed-family configs with no executable source/swap family, V3 source reuse inside V3 swap routes, and flash sources that cannot currently cover the computed borrow amount.
- **Callback verification remains protocol-specific and narrow.** `v3v3` and `v3v2` validate the Uniswap V3 flash callback against the configured factory/init code hash, while `v2v3` validates the Uniswap V2 flash pair against the configured factory mapping.
- **Gas ceiling.** The bot skips execution during gas spikes.
- **Health check.** HTTP endpoint at `/health` (default port 8080) for monitoring. In Docker, `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` can override the configured port so the app, container healthcheck, and published port stay aligned.
- **Pool discovery is cached locally.** Auto-discovered pool lists are persisted under `.cache/pool-discovery` to make restarts and periodic rediscovery cheaper.

## Analytics

Keeper logs are structured JSON lines. `npm run analytics:executions -- <log-file...>` reads those logs and summarizes execution payouts by strategy, chain, submission mode, price source, and pool.

Successful live executions now include both:

- estimated P&L from the pre-trade strategy decision
- realized P&L from post-receipt wallet balance deltas plus gas spent

If you pipe logs from Docker or systemd, send them through the script directly:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs keeper | npm run analytics:executions --
```
